🎓 Postdoctoral Fellow at The University of Göttingen. 

🤝 Combining machine learning models and data.

📊 Research on: 
 (1) Modeling, simulating, and parameterizing membranes and proteins through advanced machine learning techniques.
 (2) Neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles, specifically exploring processes like fusion and fission. 
 (3) Thermal conductivity and phonon transport in semiconductors (silicon) and supermaterials (graphene).
 (4) Self-assembly of surfactants at interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations.
 (5) Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Lithium Ion Batteries.

🐍 Machine learning and object-oriented programming (Python, C++) are my tools.  

🤔 AI is powerful, but remembering the past is crucial—Terminator warned us about that.
